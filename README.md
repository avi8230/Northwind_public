# Project Description

I developed this project while learning React. Each skill I acquired in React was implemented by building a corresponding component that demonstrates that specific capability.

In addition to that, I also built a server-side using NodeJS to enable working with React on the server side.

To run the project fully, it is necessary to start the local server on your computer.
