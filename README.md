# Northwind-React-Project

## Project Description

I developed this project while learning React. Each skill I acquired in React was implemented by building a corresponding component that demonstrates that specific capability.

In addition to that, I also built a server-side using NodeJS to enable working with React on the server side.

## Live Demo

You can view the project live on [https://northwind-ap.web.app](https://northwind-ap.web.app){:target="_blank"}.

**Note:** The website accessed through this link functions solely as the frontend; the backend needs to be activated locally on the computer to ensure the full functionality of the site.
